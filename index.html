          <p> I am Nikhil Dhirmalani, I have completed my Masterâ€™s degree in Applied Computer Science (MACS) 
            from Dalhousie University and Bachelors degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) 
            from SRM University. Being from non CS background I have completed five pre-requisite undergrad 
            computer science courses (Software Development, Data Structures and Algorithms, 
            Databases, Computer Networks, SDC) from Dalhousie before starting my masters.
             I have two years of hands-on experience as a Software Engineer at Capgemini and 
            recently completed my Co-Op as Data Scientist from Scotiabank.

            <h5 class="card-header">Ship Iceberg Kaggle Competetion</h5>
            <p class="card-body">
                A Kaggle competition where we were challenged to build an algorithm that automatically identifies if a remotely sensed
                target is a ship or iceberg.
                
                The data was in the form of an image, therefore I implemented RESNET (Residual Network) in keras, Multi
                Layer Perceptron (MLP) in tensorflow and convolutional neural network having initial layers of pre-trained
                VGG net in pytorch.
                Implemented various techniques like dropout, regularization, Batch Normalization to improve the accuracy of
                the model. Performed exploratory analysis by visualizing individual Convolution layers, weights, and gradients
                of layers using Tensorboard.

                An Android-based application used to get information about medical drugs, their benefits and side-effects.
                Implemented various visualizations i.e. Pie chart, Word cloud etc. to summarize information and present it to
                users. Implemented Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency algorithm to get unique words from drug
                reviews and show those words in a word cloud.
                Implemented CRUD operations for the user domain using google firebase as a storage option.

            <p class="card-body">
                A Java-based website used to get information about different movies and recommend movies to users based on their likes.
                Spring Boot framework is used in back-end and HTML, CSS and JavaScript in front-end. Jenkins was used as
                a Continuous Integration tool to build the application, run JUnit test cases and deploy it on Microsoft Azure
                server.
                Implemented Jaccard Similarity Score algorithm for recommending movies to users and implemented Loggers
                to log errors in the file and on the console. Responsible for writing unit, integration and browser tests of the
                application.

            <p class="card-body">
                Document clustering is an approach of grouping similar documents together.
                Implemented K-Means clustering algorithm using map-reduce transformations in Apache spark from scratch
                and compared results with K-Means implemented using MLib (machine learning library) in spark.
                Developed a web crawler in python using selenium to collect document data from the IEEE website. Currently
                working on the same project with a different approach using vector embeddings for each word and learning it
                using Conv net.

                  An application that streams tweets from twitter api based on user given queries and 
                  predicts the tweet sentiment.
                Streamed tweets using Tweepy twitter library and implemented Naive Bayes and Expected Maximization
                algorithms from scratch in python to predict the tweet sentiment.
                Developed an interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and implemented various visualizations using d3.js.

                    Stress value at risk (SVar) prediction from the given portfolios and market data.
                    Implemented neural network models, Boosting algorithms and performed the experiments as part of initial ML
                    modeling. Used spark, dask, pandas for data transformation and preparation.
                    Feature exploration and project pipeline set up on GCP. Use Dataflow for transformations and Big query to
                    store the data.
